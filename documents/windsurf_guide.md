   - For beginners, start with the default model which balances performance and speed

3. **Chat vs. Write Mode**:
   - Cascade offers two interaction modes:
     - **Chat Mode**: For conversational interactions, asking questions, or explanations
     - **Write Mode**: For direct code generation or modification
   - Switch between modes using the toggle in the Cascade panel

4. **Basic Usage Examples**:
   - **Code Explanation**: "Explain how this function works" (select code first)
   - **Code Generation**: "Create a React component for a login form"
   - **Bug Fixing**: "Fix the error in this code" (select problematic code)
   - **Refactoring**: "Refactor this code to be more efficient"

5. **Multi-File Operations**:
   - Cascade can work across multiple files in your project
   - Example: "Update all API endpoints in the project to use the new base URL"
   - Cascade will search, analyze, and modify files as needed

6. **Real-Time Awareness**:
   - Cascade stays aware of your code changes in real-time
   - If you modify files during a conversation, Cascade maintains context
